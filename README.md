# RetroGameBoy
This is just a collection of classic games done by using c++ and SFML. 
The original code for this is not mine. 
The credit should go to  FamTrinli ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC7qpnId5RIQruKDJOt2exw ). 
I'm trying to optimize it, add new features, and apply OOP principles to that project.
